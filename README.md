# What is this?

This is a hastily-written bash script which makes calls to a postgres database to output html fragment in an order so that the data may be subsequently converted into PBCore. Use at your own risk.

# How valid is the PBCore?

It's not (yet)

# How to use?

To pull a PBCore XML from the database where the media attachment's id is `SHOW1234`, try:

```
pbprotrackor SHOW1324
```
